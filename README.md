BhaariScam Token Documentation ## Overview

Contract Name: BhaariScam Symbol: **BSCAM** Standard: **ERC**-20 (Simplified, Custom Implementation) Compiler Version: pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

This contract implements a gas-efficient yet educational version of an **ERC**-20 token, designed to demonstrate:

Custom balance and allowance handling

Manual arithmetic operations (avoiding SafeMath for Solidity ‚â•0.8)

Optimized event emissions

It‚Äôs intentionally minimal, to help developers understand the core **ERC**-20 logic without dependencies.

## Key Functionalities

Function	Purpose
transfer(to, amount)	Sends tokens from caller to another address.
approve(spender, amount)	Allows another address to spend tokens on your behalf.
transferFrom(from, to, amount)	Enables a spender to move tokens from one address to another using an allowance.
balanceOf(account)	Returns balance of any address.
allowance(owner, spender)	Shows remaining tokens a spender can use.
## Security and Optimization Analysis
| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overflow/Underflow | ‚úÖ Safe (Solidity 0.8+ auto-checks) |
| Unchecked arithmetic | ‚úÖ Used intentionally for gas efficiency |
| Events | ‚úÖ Transfer and Approval correctly emitted |
| Zero-address protection | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| Front-running risk | ‚ö† Exists (standard **ERC**-20 approval flaw) |
| Reentrancy | ‚úÖ Not applicable |
| Gas optimization | ‚úÖ Manual unchecked block and direct mapping access |
## Comparison with OpenZeppelin ERC-20
| Feature | BhaariScam | OpenZeppelin **ERC**-20 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gas Efficiency | ‚úÖ Highly optimized | Standard |
| String Storage | ‚ùå bytes32 (cheaper) | ‚úÖ string (more readable) |
| Safe Transfers | ‚ùå No SafeERC20 | ‚úÖ Built-in |
| Approval Security | ‚ùå Original **ERC**-20 | ‚úÖ increaseAllowance pattern |
| Extensibility | ‚ùå Minimal | ‚úÖ Modular (Ownable, Pausable) |
## Recommendations for Production Use

‚úÖ Use OpenZeppelin‚Äôs **ERC20** as a base (audited, secure). ‚úÖ Add SafeERC20 for all contract-to-contract transfers. ‚úÖ Implement increaseAllowance / decreaseAllowance to prevent front-running. ‚úÖ Add Ownable if minting/burning capabilities are needed. ‚úÖ Emit events for all critical actions (e.g., Mint, Burn).

üß† Final Notes

Educational Value: Excellent for learning gas optimizations and storage efficiency.

Production Readiness: ‚ö† Not recommended without addressing security gaps.

Alternative: Extend OpenZeppelin‚Äôs **ERC20** for a production-ready token.
