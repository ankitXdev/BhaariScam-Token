BhaariScam Token Documentation ## Overview

Contract Name: BhaariScam Symbol: **BSCAM** Standard: **ERC**-20 (Simplified, Custom Implementation) Compiler Version: pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

This contract implements a gas-efficient yet educational version of an **ERC**-20 token, designed to demonstrate:

Custom balance and allowance handling

Manual arithmetic operations (avoiding SafeMath for Solidity ≥0.8)

Optimized event emissions

It’s intentionally minimal, to help developers understand the core **ERC**-20 logic without dependencies.

## Key Functionalities

Function	Purpose
transfer(to, amount)	Sends tokens from caller to another address.
approve(spender, amount)	Allows another address to spend tokens on your behalf.
transferFrom(from, to, amount)	Enables a spender to move tokens from one address to another using an allowance.
balanceOf(account)	Returns balance of any address.
allowance(owner, spender)	Shows remaining tokens a spender can use.
## Security and Optimization Analysis
Area	Status	Notes
Overflow/Underflow	✅ Safe (Solidity 0.8+ auto-checks)	
Unchecked arithmetic	✅ Used intentionally for gas efficiency	
Events	✅ Transfer and Approval correctly emitted	
Zero-address protection	✅ Implemented	
Front-running risk	⚠ Exists (standard **ERC**-20 approval flaw)	
Reentrancy	✅ Not applicable	
Gas optimization	✅ Manual unchecked block and direct mapping access	
## Comparison with OpenZeppelin ERC-20
Feature	BhaariScam	OpenZeppelin **ERC**-20
Gas Efficiency	✅ Highly optimized	Standard
String Storage	❌ bytes32 (cheaper)	✅ string (more readable)
Safe Transfers	❌ No SafeERC20	✅ Built-in
Approval Security	❌ Original **ERC**-20	✅ increaseAllowance pattern
Extensibility	❌ Minimal	✅ Modular (Ownable, Pausable)
## Recommendations for Production Use

✅ Use OpenZeppelin’s **ERC20** as a base (audited, secure). ✅ Add SafeERC20 for all contract-to-contract transfers. ✅ Implement increaseAllowance / decreaseAllowance to prevent front-running. ✅ Add Ownable if minting/burning capabilities are needed. ✅ Emit events for all critical actions (e.g., Mint, Burn).

🧠 Final Notes

Educational Value: Excellent for learning gas optimizations and storage efficiency.

Production Readiness: ⚠ Not recommended without addressing security gaps.

Alternative: Extend OpenZeppelin’s **ERC20** for a production-ready token.
