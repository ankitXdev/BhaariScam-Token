BhaariScam Token Documentation
1. Overview
Contract Name: BhaariScam
Symbol: BSCAM
Standard: ERC-20 (Simplified, Custom Implementation)
Compiler Version: pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
This contract implements a gas-efficient yet educational version of an ERC-20 token, designed to demonstrate:


Custom balance and allowance handling


Manual arithmetic operations (avoiding SafeMath for Solidity ≥0.8)


Optimized event emissions


It’s intentionally minimal, to help developers understand the core ERC-20 logic without dependencies.

2. Key Functionalities
FunctionPurposetransfer(to, amount)Sends tokens from caller to another address.approve(spender, amount)Allows another address to spend tokens on your behalf.transferFrom(from, to, amount)Enables a spender to move tokens from one address to another using an allowance.balanceOf(account)Returns balance of any address.allowance(owner, spender)Shows remaining tokens a spender can use.

3. Security and Optimization Analysis
AreaStatusNotesOverflow/Underflow✅ Safe (Solidity 0.8+ auto-checks)Unchecked arithmetic✅ Used intentionally for gas efficiencyEvents✅ Transfer and Approval correctly emittedZero-address protection✅ ImplementedFront-running risk⚠ Exists (standard ERC-20 approval flaw)Reentrancy✅ Not applicableGas optimization✅ Manual unchecked block and direct mapping access

4. Comparison with OpenZeppelin ERC-20

5. Recommendations for Production Use
✅ Use OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 as a base (audited, secure).
✅ Add SafeERC20 for all contract-to-contract transfers.
✅ Implement increaseAllowance / decreaseAllowance to prevent front-running.
✅ Add Ownable if minting/burning capabilities are needed.
✅ Emit events for all critical actions (e.g., Mint, Burn).

🧠 Final Notes


Educational Value: Excellent for learning gas optimizations and storage efficiency.


Production Readiness: ⚠ Not recommended without addressing security gaps.


Alternative: Extend OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 for a production-ready token.
